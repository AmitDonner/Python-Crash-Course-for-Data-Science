# Python's crash course for data scientists
During the Summer of 2022 I had the honor of being part of the teaching staff of the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS)](https://sicss.io/2022/haifa/) which took place at Haifa university. 

During this program I built from scratch a 5-days crash course in Python. 

The course started a short introduction to programming with Python, and moved on to important modules as *numpy*, *pandas*, *matplotlib* and *seaborn*. 

This repository includes 5 presentations with many important functions, methods and examples which are consider as *must to know* for each begginer and intermediate data scientists.

Enjoy!
